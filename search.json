But certainly you likely do similar tasks over and over, maybe using the same tools (e.g., Excel), or maybe a number of different tools. Are your tools re-usable? Can you reproduce your work efficiently and easily, building on the previous experience?\nNo matter the answer to these questions, this workshop will try to get through some of the basic principles of data wrangling and summarizing in R, how to re-use these tools, and how to build a reproducible workflow you can use to tackle whatever data challenge gets thrown your way.\nWe will walk through how to get data into R, how to summarize, join, and plot our data, as well as how to make some basic maps. Finally, we will touch on how to put this into a single report that you can re-use or revise as you see fit.\nThis course is for you if you:\n\ndo data analysis in Excel\ndo anything with spreadsheets and environmental data\nuse a computer regularly\ngenerate summaries or reports that use environmental data\nhave used R before\nhave never used R before",

Styles, Themes, and Layouts adapted/reused from the excellent posit::conf(2024) repo, specifically the Quarto Dashboard Workshop. Some fantastic resources exist that have been invaluable for learning how to put these types of workshops together, thanks to the open, available, and re-useable approach folks have taken.
