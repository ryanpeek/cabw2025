R is an amazing tool, and often there are many ways to do the same thing, however we always need to start with data!\n\n## Data Background \n\nThe data set we are using is a subset of the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and the Algal Stream Condition Index (ASCI). These data represent a portion of the sampling sites that were used to develop each index. The CSCI is based on the comparison of the observed assemblage of benthic macroinvertebrate species to those expected from studying reference streams. It provides a scientifically robust way of assessing and describing conditions and tracking conditions over time or in response to regulatory or restoration actions. Theses indices are built on a few main components:\n\n - Ratio of observed to expected taxanomic groups (`OE`) \n - Proportion of the assemblage that falls into different functional groups that represent species diversity, ecosystem function, and sensitivity to stress.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\n![Drawing of a Caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae), K. Mertz, 2015.](../images/trichop_ecogeo_keiko_mertz.jpg){fig-alt=\"A drawing of a Caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae), K. Mertz\"}\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nThe `CSCI` value is not normalized to a 0 to 1 or 100 scale, but instead compares Index values at test sites to values at comparable reference sites. The mean Index value of reference sites is 1.01. The 90th percentile value is 0.85, thus:\n\n - streams with values >0.85 are considered to be <span style=\"color:green;\">**likely intact**</span>\n - streams with values between 0.72 and 0.85 are considered <span style=\"color:orange;\">**likely altered**</span>\n - streams with values <0.72 are considered <span style=\"color:#7D1A03;\">**very likely altered**</span>\n\nFor more information about these data, and lots of great research showing the utility for monitoring, watershed health, and more, check out [here](https://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/TechnicalReports/883_CSCI-StatewideBioScoringTool.pdf), [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioassessment/docs/csci_tech_memo.pdf), [here](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/684130) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20303587?via%3Dihub).\n\n## Import (Read In) Data\n\nLet's get some data to play with! To start, we'll use a URL of the data set we want to work with, and read it directly from the interwebs into R. It is a `.csv`, which means we can use a `read.csv` function, which is one of the functions that comes built in to R (*often called `base` R*).\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## 📣 Interactive Code!\n\nThe code below is interactive, meaning you can type and change different things and then click `Run Code` each time to run `R` right in the browser. This will run **all** the code in the chunk. If you are following along in RStudio, run these commands in the **Console**.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\n# give the full URL to our data (a csv file)\ncsci_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/cabw2025/refs/heads/main/data/cscidat.csv\"\n\n# read in this data and assign it to the name `cscidat`\ncscidat <- read.csv(csci_url)\n\n# check if it worked and get number of rows\nnrow(cscidat)\n\n# try the same with the asci data:\n# give the full URL to our data (a csv file)\nasci_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/cabw2025/refs/heads/main/data/ascidat.csv\"\n\n# read it in with read.csv and check nrow\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have data! What did we do? We used `<-` assignment to save an object into our Environment. In RStudio, take a look at the *Environment* tab, when we save or assign a value, it should show up there! \n\n![](../images/environment.png)\n\n## Data Structures in R\n\nLet's try to learn a little more about the kind of data we have. We know it came from a `.csv`, but in R (and programming generally), there are some specific types and forms of data that we should be aware of. We can use a few more functions here, `str()` for structure, and `head()` for the first few rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\n# take a quick look at the first few rows of data\nhead(cscidat)\n\n# look at the data types\nstr(cscidat)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a bewildering number of formats for storing data and R is no exception. Understanding the basic building blocks that make up data types is essential. All functions in R require specific types of input data and the key to using functions is knowing how these types relate to each other. We're going talk about a few of the most common.\n\n### Vectors (one-dimensional data)\n\nThe basic data format in R is a vector - a one-dimensional grouping of elements that have the same data type. These are all vectors and they are created with the `c()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\ndbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)\nint_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)\nlog_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)\nchr_var <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nclass(dbl_var)\nlength(log_var)\n\n# taking the mean of a character vector?\nmean(chr_var)\n\n# adding vectors of the same type?\nint_var + int_var\n\n# adding vectors of different types?\ndbl_var + int_var\n\n### can we add logical types together? Try it!\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four types of atomic vectors (think atoms that make up a molecule aka vector) are double (or numeric), integer, logical, and character. Each type has some useful properties and each helps define limits or constraints on the data. Basically, functions in R require a specific types of data, and won't work without them. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## 📣 Common errors\nPlay around with these because beyond typing errors, one of the most common issues is data that is of the wrong structure or type. Get to know the basic building blocks!\n:::\n\n### Data Frames (2 Dimensional Vectors!)\n\nWe are likely familiar with a spreadsheet...which is a type of two-dimensional data. In R, the cool thing is that a collection of vectors is a data frame, which keeps **columns** as vectors of the same type of data. Just as in a spreadsheet, a column describes a variable and rows link observations between columns. \n\nLet's look at our `cscidat` again.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\nclass(cscidat)\n\nhead(cscidat)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## 📣 Data frame constraints\n\nIn R, the only constraints required to make a data frame are:\n\n - Each column contains the same type of data\n - The number of observations in each column is equal.\n\nThese are good practices to use in spreadsheets too!\n\n:::\n\n\n## Installing Packages\n\nThe `base` install of R is quite powerful, but the universe of R programming is an amazing place, and there are are many thousands of **packages** available that provide *functions* we can use for all kinds of things. This diversity and flexibility is what makes R awesome (*and sometimes frustrating!*). Packages are the spellbooks we can download and install for use. There is so much to say about packages regarding finding them, using them, etc., but for now let’s focus just on the basics.\n\n> **CRAN**: One of the reasons for R’s popularity is CRAN, The Comprehensive R Archive Network. This is where you download R and also where most will gain access to packages (there are other places, but that is for later). Not much else to say about this now other than to be aware of it. As of Fall 2025, there are +22,800 packages on CRAN!\n\nWhen a package gets installed, that means the source code is downloaded and put into your local computer R library. A default library location is set for you, so let's download some packages! \n\n**Try this in RStudio on your own by running the following code in the `Console`:**\n\n```\n\n# install packages from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\n\n```\n\nOnce our Console returns back to the `>` symbol and there is no red stop sign in the upper right hand corner of Rstudio, let's see if the installation worked. Try the following in your console:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n##  📣 Packages\n\nWe only need to install packages once per R version, but we need to **load** packages every session before we can use them with the `library()` function.\n\n:::\n\nIf everything worked, hopefully we'll see something like below. Don't worry if the version numbers are slightly different, these can change depending on the operating system and version of R you are using.\n\n![](../images/package_load.png)\n\n## Getting Help!\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## 📣 Important Note\n\nIf you only take one thing away from today, please make sure it is this: there are many, many options to get help from. Part of learning is sifting through, trying, failing, and trying again. Don't be discouraged if something isn't working, please reach out and leverage your R community!\n\n:::\n\nBeing able to find help and interpret that help is probably one of the most important skills for learning a new language. R is no different. Help on functions and packages can be accessed directly from R, can be found on CRAN and other official R resources, searched on Google, etc.\n\n### Help from the console\n\nGetting help from the console is straightforward and can be done numerous ways. Try some of the commands below and see what happens in RStudio. When you know the name of a function, use the console and type `help(<function>)` or `?<function>`\n\n```\n# Using the help command/shortcut\nhelp(\"print\") # Help on the print command\n?print # Help on the print command using the `?` shortcut\n\n# When you know the name of the package\nhelp(package = \"sf\") # Help on the package `dplyr`\n\n\n# Don't know the exact name or just part of it\napropos(\"print\") # Returns all available functions with \"print\" in the name\n\n??print # shortcut, but also searches demos and vignettes in a formatted page\n\n```\n\nWhile the resources already mentioned are useful, often the quickest way is to just turn to Google (and now LLM).\n\nHowever, searching for “R” answers straight from Google can be challenging and still requires understanding what the question (or error) actually is. A few tips:\n\n - When using search engines, always preface the search with “`r`” or \"`[R]`\"\n - Get a sense of what sources are reliable\n - Take note of the number of hits and date of a web page\n - When in doubt, search with the exact error message (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Exception-handling-1) for details about warnings vs errors)\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## {{<  fa arrows-turn-right color=orange >}} Using LLMs\n\nUsing tools like ChatGPT can be helpful. Some models are better than others for R, but just a strong caution and general bit of advice. \n\n**Make sure to understand each piece of code that you run when getting suggestions for code from LLMs. Sometimes it will be great, sometimes it will be very wrong, and many times it's a combination of both.**\n\nLearning to program requires repetition, both in success *and* in failure, and understanding why something breaks can be much more informative to learning than knowing something just works.\n:::\n",
