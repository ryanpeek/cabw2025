Ideally folks will have a chance to run through this prior to the workshop. It is one of the hurdles to getting going, but it gets easier!

## Software

The software that we will need is as follows. We recommend installing in this order as well. More detailed instructions can be found at each site, and [here](https://r4wrds.netlify.app/intro/m_install_r), (follow Steps 1 & 2).

### R

-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org)

-   [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)

### Packages

The next step is to install a few packages, which are libraries of functions (more on these later) that we can use to do different things. We install packages available for all R users from an online repository called [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), by pasting the following code into the RStudio Console window and hitting `ENTER`.

For our purposes we will be using a few packages, let's try to install them now.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# we make a concatenated list of packages
pkg_list <- c(
  "tidyverse", "janitor", "here", "sf", "tigris"
)
# then install each package in the list
install.packages(pkg_list)
```
